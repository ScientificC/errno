# CONTRIBUTING

## Unit Tests

Bug fixes should have a unit test with 1 or more test cases indicating what the problem was and now ensuring that it is fixed.

Unit tests can be executed as follows

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make && ctest
```

## Building Packages and Installers

There is a built in packager using CPack. To build a tar.gz file, do as follows.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make && ctest && cpack -G "TGZ"
```

In addition, CPack comes with additional packagers. See the CPack documentation for more information.
